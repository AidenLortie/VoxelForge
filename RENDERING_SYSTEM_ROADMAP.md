# VoxelForge Rendering System Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the complete development roadmap for integrating **OpenTK 5.0.0-pre.15** with the VoxelForge client system. The goal is to create a robust rendering system that can display the voxel world, handle chunk rendering efficiently, and eventually support entity and player rendering.

## Architecture Principles

### Current State
- **Server**: Authoritative world state, manages chunks and block updates
- **Client**: Maintains local world copy, handles networking, currently console-only
- **Shared**: Common code including World, Chunk, Block systems, networking, physics

### Target State
- **Server**: Continue managing authoritative world state, NO rendering responsibilities
- **Client**: Add OpenTK window, rendering pipeline, camera system, input handling
- **Shared**: Extend to support entity data transmission alongside chunk data

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Player Authority**: Initially player state lives on client, eventually migrate to server authority
2. **Rendering Location**: ALL rendering happens client-side only
3. **World Authority**: Server remains authoritative for world state (blocks)
4. **Entity Data Flow**: Extend chunk packet system to also transmit entity updates

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Texture Style**: Pixel art (16x16) vs high-res? â Recommend 16x16 for classic voxel look
2. **Entity Models**: Custom format vs .obj vs voxel-based? â Start with simple cubes, add custom format later
3. **Physics Engine**: Use existing VoxelForge physics or integrate external library? â Use existing, extend as needed
4. **Networking Protocol**: Keep current TCP or add UDP for real-time updates? â Keep TCP for now, UDP is future optimization
5. **Chunk Loading Strategy**: Load all at once vs progressive? â Progressive loading based on view distance
6. **Lighting Model**: Simple vertex lighting vs per-pixel lighting? â Start simple, add complexity later

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Performance**: Mesh generation and rendering may be slow
   - Mitigation: Profile early, implement multithreading, use LOD
2. **Network Latency**: Entity updates may be laggy
   - Mitigation: Client-side prediction, interpolation
3. **Scope Creep**: Feature list is extensive
   - Mitigation: Stick to phased approach, complete phases before moving on

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **OpenTK Stability**: Pre-release version may have bugs
   - Mitigation: Test thoroughly, be ready to downgrade or report issues
2. **Complexity**: Rendering system is complex
   - Mitigation: Break into small tasks, test incrementally

### Low Priority Risks
1. **Cross-platform Issues**: Different behavior on different OS
   - Mitigation: Test on multiple platforms regularly
