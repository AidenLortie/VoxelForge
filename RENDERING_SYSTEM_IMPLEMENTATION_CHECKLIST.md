## Common Issues During Implementation

### OpenGL Context Issues
- **Symptom**: Window opens but nothing renders
- **Check**: Context version (should be 3.3+), Core profile enabled
- **Fix**: Specify GameWindowSettings with correct GL version

### Mesh Not Visible
- **Symptom**: Window renders but chunks are invisible
- **Check**: Vertex data uploaded, shader bound, matrices set
- **Fix**: Debug with simpler geometry (single triangle)

### Poor Performance
- **Symptom**: Low FPS, stuttering
- **Check**: Mesh regeneration frequency, frustum culling, draw calls
- **Fix**: Profile with tools, optimize hot paths

### Network Desync
- **Symptom**: Client and server worlds differ
- **Check**: Packet handlers registered, serialization correct
- **Fix**: Log packets to verify transmission

### Player Stuck in Ground
- **Symptom**: Player falls through or gets stuck in blocks
- **Check**: Collision detection logic, bounding box size
- **Fix**: Adjust bounding box, fix collision resolution
